Life passes most people by while they're making plans for it.
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.
Comparison will kill you.
Eat more cucumbers.
Life is good. Keep it simple.
Dont waste your time fitting in.
Be strong.
You can't do everything, so do what's important.
Life is a mystery, Everyone must stand alone, I hear you call my name, And it feels like home...
You can't be what you can't see.
