Life passes most people by while they're making plans for it.
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.
Comparison will kill you.
Eat more cucumbers.
Life is good. Keep it simple.
Dont waste your time fitting in.
You can't do everything, so do what's important.
Life is a mystery, Everyone must stand alone, I hear you call my name, And it feels like home...
You can't be what you can't see.
Everything is amazing and no one is happy.
When's the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn't hold the memories in?
The hardest thing in the world is to simplify your life. It's so easy to make it complex. What's important is leading an examined life.
Happiness leads to success. Success does not lead to happiness.
Simplify.
